    <h2><small>by <a href="https://twitter.com/redshiftzero">Jennifer Helsby</a> for <a href="https://lucyparsonslabs.com">Lucy Parsons Labs</a></small></h2>
    <p>Chicago is one of the most heavily surveilled cities in the world. Cameras, automatic license plate readers, cell site simulators and many other surveillance devices are currently used in the city by the Chicago Police Department and its sister agencies. However, many Chicago residents are unaware of the scope of the surveillance systems, their huge cost, and the privacy implications of their use. Here we survey the major parts of the surveillance system in Chicago with respect to: </p>

    <p class="tab"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> legal and privacy concerns </p>

    <p>This intro to police surveillance technologies was produced from ongoing research through FOIA documents acquired by <a href="https://lucyparsonslabs.com">Lucy Parsons Labs</a> as well as some public data. We'll be updating this intro as we learn more through our ongoing investigations. <a href="mailto:jen@redshiftzero.com">Email the author</a> if you would like to submit other data.</p>

    <h1>Surveillance Cameras</h1>
    <p>Video monitoring is the most well-known part of Chicago's surveillance infrastructure, consisting of a network of well over 50,000 cameras (including cameras on the CTA). This system is operated by Chicago's Office of Emergency Management (OEMC).

  	<div class="row">
  	<h3> <span class="glyphicons glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker"></span> Where</h3> 
    <p>The locations of the subset of cameras operated by CPD and DHS are known, as they are not intended to be covert. A map of these "blue light" cameras - so called due to the flashing bright blue light on some of the older cameras operated by CPD  also known as "Police Observation Devices" or PODs - in Operation Virtual Shield (OVS) is below. These locations were acquired through FOIA by the author.</p>

    <p>However, the locations of the cameras connected into the <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/oem/provdrs/tech/svcs/link_your_cameras.html">Private Sector Camera Initiative</a> - wherein private cameras from Chicago businesses and sister agencies allow their feeds to be accessed by the city - are not publically known. The author attempted to FOIA for their locations, but was denied due to "privacy reasons". Other Chicago agencies with a significant number of cameras in the network include <a href="http://eyeingchicago.com/blog/2014/10/10/how-many-cameras-in-the-cps-7000.html">Chicago Public Schools (CPS)</a>, <a href="http://eyeingchicago.com/blog/2014/10/10/how-many-cameras-in-the-cta-23000.html"> Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)</a>, <a href="http://eyeingchicago.com/blog/2014/10/14/how-many-cameras-in-the-cha-3000.html">Chicago Housing Authority (CHA)</a>, Midway and O'Hare airports, and Chicago Park District. </p>
<h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-piggy-bank"></span> Costs</h3> 
    <p>The cameras purchased by the city - ignoring the significant maintenance costs - cost from $12,000 to $29,000, depending on the version of the camera. Given that the city has thousands of cameras, this puts the cost of the camera system at least at tens of millions of taxpayer dollars. Older cameras are clearly denoted with the logo of the Chicago Police Department along with a bright blue light. Newer cameras are nondescript and blend into the environment. </p>

    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></span> Capabilities </h3>
    <p> The cameras in Operation Virtual Shield have <a href="http://www.aclu-il.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Surveillance-Camera-Report1.pdf">pan and zoom capability</a>, and are able to zoom in close enough to read a license plate or to capture a still shot for facial recognition purposes.</p>
    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span> Efficacy </h3>
    <p> Police <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704538404574539910412824756">claim a reduction</a> in crime in the vicinity of the cameras. However, no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial">experimental study has been performed</a> that controls for the many other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding">confounding</a> factors that are present - including other CPD programs intended to reduce crime. Agencies like the CTA claim that <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/safety/cameras.aspx">hundreds of arrests</a> have resulted at least in part from their cameras.</p>
       <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> Legal and Privacy Concerns</h3>
    <p> There are numerous privacy implications associated with a pervasive video monitoring system. While the cameras capture people moving in public spaces, Chicago residents' reasonable expectation of privacy may not extend to cameras capturing their attendance at political meetings, religious events, or medical appointments. Video surveillance as widespread as in Chicago may constitute a real threat to freedom of expression and association. </p>

    <p> In addition, there need to be clear privacy policies governing the collection and storage of footage from the OEMC video surveillance system. There should not be indefinite storage of data captured from cameras unless related to an ongoing investigation. An important accountability issue concerns the detection and prevention of abuse by camera operators that may use the cameras to monitor and track Chicago residents without a legitimate public safety or law enforcement purpose. It is currently unknown how often this occurs. </p>

    <h1>Automatic License Plate Recognition</h1>
    <p>Automatic License Plate Recognition, or ALPR, take images of vehicles in public spaces, analyze the text on their license plates, and record the timestamp and position of the car (based on GPS coordinates). </p>

    <p>Unknown since many ALPRs are mobile. However, LPL is currently suing for the locations of stationary ALPRs. In 2019 the Chicago Police Department purchased an additional <a href ="https://news.wttw.com/2019/01/08/chicago-police-adding-200-plate-reader-vehicles-help-combat-carjackings"





> 200 </a> ALPRs, bringing the total to over 240. Each of Chicago's 25 districts has at least six ALPR-equipped police vehicles. Chicago can also use their video surveillance network to scan license plates.</p>
    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-piggy-bank"></span> Costs</h3> 
    <p>CPD has spent more than <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/17659/cpd-tightlipped-about-use-of-license-plate-scanners-despite-new-contract">$500,000</a> for software to manage and analyze data from ALPRs. In addition, each device costs <a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/02/13/cpd-license-plate-readers/"> $25,000</a>, which could bring the total expenditure to over $1.1 million.</p>
    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></span> Capabilities </h3>
    <p> Chicago Police Department purchases Motorola / PAGIS automated license plate readers. These devices track the GPS location a license plate was seen and the timestamp. The scanned plates are then checked against a Hot List that consist of plates of interest. According to FOIA documents acquired by the author, there might be as many as 300,000 license plates stored in the Hot List at any one time in Chicago - meaning that approximately 1 in 10 Chicagoans has their vehicle on the Hot List. Each plate's information is stored for 365 days unless it is <a href ="http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/"> deemed </a> 'pertinent to criminal or civil matters,' in which case it is retained until a court orders it to be removed.</p>

    <p>According to the <a href="http://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2018AnnualReport-05July19.pdf"> Chicago Police Department</a>, a vehicle mounted ALPR can capture 3,200 images of license plates in one shift. Documents from the CPD acquired by LPL show that over a two year period, ALPRs recorded over <a href="img/200milfoia.jpg"> 200 million hits</a>. CPD <a href ="http://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2018AnnualReport-05July19.pdf">claims </a>that "The recovery of stolen vehicles has increased significantly." From 2016 to 2020, carjackings have decreased by <a href="https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_PDFsam_CompStat-Publc-2020-Week-21.pdf"> 20%, </a> although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to ALPR.</p>


    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> Legal and Privacy Concerns</h3>
    <p>Even an incomplete record of where an individual's car has been provides detailed information about the activities of that person. In Oakland, over 4.6 million license plate scans from ALPR systems <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/we-know-where-youve-been-ars-acquires-4-6m-license-plate-scans-from-the-cops/">were released in a FOIA request</a>, providing detailed information about Oakland residents' activities - including activities protected by the First Amendment.</p>
    <p>Concerns over data retention policies and data sharing also should be addressed and publicly disclosed. The criteria that lands a given plate on the Hot List should be publicly disclosed. Check out the <a href="https://www.eff.org/sls/tech/automated-license-plate-readers/faq">EFF's excellent FAQ</a> on ALPR technology for more information.</p>








	<p> In 2017, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) signed a <a href=”http://www.aclu-il.org/en/press-releases/ice-targeting-immigrants-based-automatic-license-plate-reader-alpr-data-supplied”>contract</a> with Thomson Reuters which gave them access to a database with billions of nationwide license plate records gleaned from ALPRs, which they can use to track and target immigrants. In addition, ICE has signed contracts with over 80 local law enforcement agencies for their data, including <a href=”https://www.aclu-il.org/en/press-releases/ice-targeting-immigrants-based-automatic-license-plate-reader-alpr-data-supplied”>four in the Chicago area</a>.</p>
    <p> At the state level in Illinois, there are <a href="http://inthesetimes.com/article/17769/Illinois_bill_challenges_license_plate_surveillance">currently several bills</a> that have been introduced (but not yet passed) in recent years to regulate ALPR use.  A couple of these bills have been shot down, and one has been sitting <a href =”https://www.billtrack50.com/BillDetail/1047521”> in the Senate </a> for over a year.</p>
	<p> In 2018 the CPD issued a <a href=”http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/”>directive</a> that sets procedural standards for ALPR use, yet which does not clarify what purposes ALPRs can or cannot be used for.</p>

    <p>Facial recognition systems can be incredibly sophisticated, but likely what occurs in Chicago is faces captured from video are compared with shots taken upon arrest. </p>
    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span> Efficacy </h3>
    <p>At least <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/first-chicago-robber-caught-via-facial-recognition-gets-22-years/">one arrest</a> is claimed to have resulted from the use of facial recognition technology in Chicago, though the usefulness of facial recognition in even this one arrest is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/8/5982727/face-wreck-how-advanced-tech-comes-up-short-for-police">in dispute</a>. </p>
    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> Legal and Privacy Concerns</h3>
    <p> The secure storage of biometric data is increasingly important as biometrics such as fingerprints are used for authentication purposes. In Illinois we have the <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3004&ChapterID=57">Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)</a> which regulates the collection of biometric data, by required consent as well as limits on how long the data can be stored. There are currently <a href="http://www.biometricupdate.com/201508/states-considering-biometrics-capture-laws-may-look-to-illinois-privacy-laws">lawsuits</a> against companies like Facebook and Shutterfly for collecing biometric information for commercial purposes in violation of this act.

    <h1>Cell Site Simulators</h1>
    <p>Cell site simulators (CSS) or IMSI catchers, also often referred to as Stingrays after the device sold by Harris Corporation, are controversial cellphone surveillance devices. They operate by masquerading as a cellphone tower, forcing any phones in the vicinity to connect to them. </p>
	<p>Very little information about how CPD uses CSS is available to the public. Documents obtained through FOIA lawsuits by LPL and ACLU have revealed that the CPD, FBI, and Harris Corporation have gone to great lengths to maintain secrecy around the purchase and use of CSS. </p>

However there do exists some efforts <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.srlabs.snoopsnitch&hl=en">to</a> <a href="https://secupwn.github.io/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/">detect</a> them.</p>
    <p>According to documents obtained through FOIA, the CPD’s CSS system is <a href="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/publications/stingrays-and-chicago-police-department#_ftn9">stationed</a> in the back of an unmarked Black SUV sits at Homan Square, the CPD facility in North Lawndale. </p>
	<h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-piggy-bank"></span> Costs</h3> 
    <p>Over the last ten years, over $700,000 has been spent on cell tracking equipment including Harris Corporations's Stingray, KingFish, and AmberJack and Digital Receiver Technologies' DRTBox. The details of cell site simulator purchases is known from work by Freddy Martinez, who first revealed that Chicago police had purchased Stingray devices from Harris corporation and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2185449-15-3508-responsive-documents.html">Ali Winston</a>, who <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/chicago-and-los-angeles-have-used-dirt-box-surveillance-for-a-decade/">revealed</a> that cell site simulators had been first purchased by Chicago police as far back as 2005.</p>
    <p>The CPD has used “1505 funds,” money seized through <a href="https://lucyparsonslabs.com/projects/assetforfeiture/">civil forfeiture</a> in drug related investigations, to finance these purchases. The CPD has also sought to <a href="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/publications/stingrays-and-chicago-police-department#_ftn15">obscure</a> the costs of CSS technology from the public by censoring invoices and excluding expense records from their inventory asset management system.</p>
	<p>In addition, the CPD has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars fighting a <a href="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/publications/stingrays-and-chicago-police-department#_ftn34">lawsuit</a> over a FOIA request for records surrounding cell site simulators, which it eventually lost. </p> 
	<h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></span> Capabilities </h3>
    <p> Depending on <a href="https://theintercept.com/surveillance-catalogue/">the model and upgrades available</a> on the specific cell site simulator, these devices can be used to get the International Mobile Subscriber Identities (IMSI) of those near the cell site simulator, can be used to interfere with the cellphone's ability to make calls and send texts (denial of service), and in some cases can enable the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/09/meet-the-machines-that-steal-your-phones-data/">interception of the content</a> of messages and calls. Read more at the EFF's excellent FAQ about <a href="https://www.eff.org/sls/tech/cell-site-simulators/faq">Cell Site Simulators</a>.</p>

    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> Legal and Privacy Concerns</h3>
    <p>There are serious legal questions surrounding cell site simulators. The manner in which these devices operate involves the indiscriminate data collection <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/blog/new-docs-doj-admits-stingrays-spy-innocent-bystanders">from phones of innocent bystanders</a>. </p>
	
	<p>The largest concern surrounding cell site simulators is the deliberate secrecy around their use. The CPD does not keep a log of CSS use, and there are no directives in place outlining protocols for CSS related activity, as there are with most other surveillance technologies. The CPD has also signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the FBI requiring them to inform the bureau if there are any Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests from the public seeking information about this technology, enabling the FBI to <a href ="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/publications/stingrays-and-chicago-police-department#_ftn21">“seek to prevent disclosure through appropriate channels.”</a></p>
	
	<p>In 2017 the Citizen Privacy Protection Act (CPPA) went into effect in Illinois. This law requires any use of a CSS to be validated by a court order, and restricts CSS use to locating, tracking, and identifying communications devices, rather than capturing the content of communications. CPD officers <a href ="https://www.aclu-il.org/en/publications/stingrays-and-chicago-police-department#_ftn32">claim</a> that CSSs are almost never used without a court order, and that each order is carefully reviewed for compliance with the CPPA. However, the CPD, Cook County State's Attorney, and City Clerk have denied numerous FOIA requests by the ACLU and LPL for court orders and warrants relating to CSS use. Without adequate recordkeeping or avenues for the public to access those records, it is impossible to tell whether CPD employs CSS lawfully and ethically.</p>
	
    <p>Recently, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice have both published new policies on the use of these devices at the federal level, requiring warrants for their use. In Chicago, these devices have been used with Pen Register/Trap and Trace orders but <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/matter-application-united-states-america-order-relating-telephones-used-suppressed">not warrants</a>. </p>

    <p>These devices are also potentially in violation of <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3582&ChapterID=54">state level protection from local surveillance regulation</a>. </p>

    <p>These devices are used for the detection of gunshots. They operate by distributing sensors over a broad area, and using the sound wave and time of arrival at each sensor for detecting gunshots and localizing the position of the gunshot.</p>
    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span> Efficacy </h3>
    <p>Efficacy of the devices in Chicago is unknown. There are <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2012/03/20/shotspotter-faces-uncertain-future/">several</a> reports of issues concerning false positives reported by the Shotspotter system. However, it does appear that gun crime is <a href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-04-20/news/bs-md-ci-gunshot-detection-report-20140420_1_baltimore-police-gun-discharges-gun-violence">significantly underreported</a> in many US cities.</p>
    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> Legal and Privacy Concerns</h3>
    <p> Shotspotter is marketing its technology for several new markets, including in schools for school shooting early detection and response. However, the increasing use of this technology in areas where people will be speaking raises concerns with how the data is handled and stored, as the Shotspotter microphones may incidentally pick up a nearby conversation. </p>

    <h1>Predictive Policing</h1>
    <p>Since 2012, the CPD has used a statistical model to predict the likelihood of someone becoming a “Party to Violence” (PTV), or be involved as either a victim or offender of a violent crime. The model, developed in collaboration with the Illinois Institute of Technology, was initially called the Strategic Subject List (SSL) and was later revised and renamed the Crime and Victimization Risk Model (CVRM). This model was quietly <a id="cvrmlink" href="https://igchicago.org/2020/01/23/advisory-concerning-the-chicago-police-departments-predictive-risk-models/">decommissioned</a> by the CPD in 2019.</p>

    <h3> <span class="glyphicons glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker"></span> Where</h3> 
    <p>The CVRM was meant to play a key role in CPD’s new <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3242.html">Strategic Decision and Support Centers (SDSCs)</a>, "real time crime centers" which are now located in all but two of Chicago’s 22 districts. Officers could also view at risk individuals identified by the CVRM on a phone app.</p>

    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-piggy-bank"></span> Costs</h3> 
    <p>CPD received $3.8 million in federal grants to develop the SSL and CVRM. CPD also paid close to<a href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/dps/SoleSource/NCRB2017/ApprovedNCRBUOCcrimelab0217.pdf"> $1.2 million</a> to a team led by University of Chicago’s Crime Lab for technical assistance in crime reduction initiatives, including a “Total overhaul of mission assignments to use predictive analytics and SSL on offenders.” Of this sum, $200,000 was alloted to Sean Malinowski, a former LAPD chief of staff who marshalled LAPD’s use of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-21/lapd-ends-predictive-policing-program">controversial predictive policing software,</a> which it recently ended.</p>

    <h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open"></span> Capabilities </h3>
    <p> CPD’s PTV model outputs a risk classification for anyone arrested in Chicago over the past four years (over 300,000 people). The model’s output is based on risk factors such as a subject’s age and involvement in various types of crimes, with more recent incidents being given a higher weight than older ones. Individuals’ scores are also influenced by the scores of co-arestees. IIT provided a <a href="https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/FACT-SHEET-Crime-and-Victimization-Risk-Model-1.pdf">fact sheet</a> which describes the model in greater detail. Note, however, that the model and its inputs and outputs have changed over time. Previously, the model took into account gang affiliation based on the now defunct (although soon to be revamped) <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/2/26/21155215/cpd-revamp-controversial-gang-database">gang database</a>.</p>
    <p>CVRM contributed to the <a href="https://home.chicagopolice.org/information/violence-reduction-strategy-vrs/">Custom Notification Program</a>, whereby at risk individuals and families are contacted and visited, reminded of the risk of being involved in violent crime, and connected with social services. </p>
	<p>SSL and CVRM scores were also being used to <a href="https://igchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/OIG-Advisory-Concerning-CPDs-Predictive-Risk-Models-.pdf">assist in investigations</a> and mission related activity, although it is unclear to what extent.</p>
	<h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></span> Efficacy </h3>
    <p>IIT <a href="https://home.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/FACT-SHEET-Crime-and-Victimization-Risk-Model-1.pdf">claims</a> that among the individuals with the highest CVRM risk scores, about one in three will be involved in a shooting incident within 18 months of the classification. </p>
    <p>In a review of SDSCs and the CVRM, the Rand Corporation found the CVRM to be <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3242.html">”operationally unsuitable”</a> as the model takes many months to run, and it must be run at IIT, which stopped working on the CVRM because of the expiration of grants for the project.</p>
	<p>In addition, the report notes that the model doesn’t take into account factors that would be necessary to identify appropriate interventions for those at risk, such as educational, medical, and social factors, which would fall outside of police records and which would be difficult to quantify.</p>
	<p>An earlier RAND study from 2016 found that the first version of the SSL was <a href="https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/August-2016/Chicago-Police-Data/">essentially ineffective</a> in predicting homicide victims. CPD disputes this study, claiming that the model has changed since then. However, due to the lack of transparency surrounding these models and CPD’s reluctance to evaluate them, it is impossible for the public to understand whether or not these models are effective. </p>
	<h3> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign"></span> Legal and Privacy Concerns</h3>
    <p> Although the PTV model’s developers claim that it does not take race and other social factors into account, <a href="https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/August-2017/Chicago-Police-Strategic-Subject-List/">56%</a> of all Black males between 20 and 29 had an SSL score. The model is trained on historical arrest data which is skewed due to biased policing practices. An investigative report by <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">ProPublica</a> from 2016 revealed how predictive policing algorithms tend to disproportionately target people of color.</p>
    <p>In addition, there are <a href="https://southsideweekly.com/predictive-policing-long-road-transparency/">concerns</a> that the CVRM unfairly targets subjects who are involved in petty crimes by weighting connections with co-arrestees </p>
    <p>A major concern around CPD’s use of PTV modelling, as with most of the department’s uses of technology, is its secrecy. An anonymized version of the SSL was released in 2017, five years after its initial development, after a legal battle with the <a href="https://www.chicagomag.com/city-life/August-2017/Chicago-Police-Strategic-Subject-List/">Chicago Sun-Times</a>. A spokesperson for the CPD claimed that PTV scores were not being used for law enforcement purposes, yet this turned out to be false. The CPD also told the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) that data from PTV models was not being shared, yet<a href="https://igchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/OIG-Advisory-Concerning-CPDs-Predictive-Risk-Models-.pdf"> OIG</a> found that CPD was in fact sharing this data with multiple public agencies, including the State Attorney’s Office, which may have used SSL scores to aid in prosecutions. This last point is particularly worrying, since individuals are given an SSL score if they are arrested and not necessarily charged or found guilty of any crime. </p>

    <h1>What's Next</h1>
    <p>Chicago residents have legitimate questions surrounding the use of these technologies: Are appropriate policies and procedures in place to ensure these systems are responsibly used? To what degree are these systems necessary or even useful? Do the benefits of these systems justify the tens of millions of taxpayer dollars being spent on them? Do members of the public want this level of surveillance to be used? </p>
    <p>In the past, police surveillance of public spaces was constrained by resources such as availability of police officers. However, surveillance technology is producing a significant expansion of police capabilities. Police were historically unable to follow every resident with a police car, but with new surveillance technologies they may be able to effectively accomplish the same goal albeit in a less disruptive manner.</p>
    <p>Members of the public need to recognize the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2680266">far-reaching implications</a> of giving over this level of power to law enforcement. The transition from police officers having a restricted ability to follow and monitor suspicious people to having pervasive surveillance capabilities is occurring in our city today. We must have public knowledge of surveillance capabilities, policies and procedures in order to have the critical debate about this infrastructure as well as to campaign for transparency and accountability. </p>
